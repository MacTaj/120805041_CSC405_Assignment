        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 200px; padding-right: 200px; padding-bottom: 1em; text-align: justify;">
        My name is Adeleke 'AbdulLah Bello, as you can see up there and my sobriquet is MacTaj. MacTaj is formed from the old English world for 'child of', Mac and my father's name, Tajudeen. I am a student of the department of computer science in the University of Lagos. I have various hobbies and I'm not about to lie about coding been a hobby, I just don't suck at it and it's a really powerful tool that could solve so many problems so I'm cool with it and recognise the opportuntities it presents one with. As for the hobbies, I'd say reading, writing, playing video games. I am not very good at socialising(ask my classmates), I wish I could be more, but I am thankful for all that I am. About what I am, I am graphics designer, a poet, a storyteller, a web designer and an amateur programmer. For what I'd like to be, a motion graphics artist, a hardcore programmer, a systems analyst, a branding expert, I don't know what the rest of the list contains yet, but I see a light at the end of the tunnel, AlhamdulilLah. 
        So feel free to peruse the various pages all centered around a most queer subject... me.
